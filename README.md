## Challenge
"AllStocksAnalysis()" is optimized. 
while looping through the data worksheet, when the stock ticker change, update running stock's ending price and total volume; find the new stock's ticker index, and get its starting price. After all done, present the resulting data in the "All Stocks Analysis" sheet.
Worksheet cell access is considered computing power expensive, it has been minimized to two in each loop normally (once for "Close", "Volume" column each).

Observation:
in 2017, all stocks, except TERP, made a positive return; in 2018, only ENPH and RUN made a positive return. Following my analysis, Steve could make a lot of money if he invested in 2017 and 2018 accordingly.
